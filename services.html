                    <p class="services-s3__text">
                        Print media advertising is a form of advertising that uses physically 
                        printed media, such as magazines and newspapers, to reach consumers, 
                        business customers and prospects. Advertisers also use digital media, 
                        such as banner ads, mobile advertising, and advertising in social media, 
                        to reach the same target audiences. The proliferation of digital media 
                        has led to a decline in advertising expenditure in traditional print 
                        media, but print isn't dead.

                    <p class="services-s3__text">
                        Advertisers can choose from a wide range of different types of newspapers, 
                        including local, regional or national titles published in daily, evening, 
                        weekly or Sunday editions. Newspapers target different readerships with 
                        a mix of content, often including sports, entertainment, business, fashion 
                        and politics in addition to local, national or world news. Advertisers can 
                        buy different sizes of advertising space, from small classified ads with 
                        text only, to display ads featuring text, photographs, illustrations and 
                        graphics in sizes up to a full page or even a double-page spread.

                        Graphic design communicates ideas or messages in a visual way. It can

                        a digestible way.

                        According to Interactive Design Foundation, ‘Graphic design is the 
                        craft of creating visual content to communicate messages. Applying 
                        visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, graphic designers use 
                        typography and pictures to meet users’ specific needs and focus on 
                        the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs to optimize 
                        the user experience.’

                        Video advertising is promotional content that plays before, during 
                        or after streaming content. Some marketing professionals also expand 
                        the video advertising definition to include display ads with video 
                        content, such as those that start playing when a person puts a mouse 
                        cursor over them and native video ads promoted on digital ad networks.

                    <p class="services-s3__text">
                        Video advertising is one of the most popular ways to reach online 
                        audiences. Experts believe video advertising will dominate the next 
                        decade, which suggests that now is an ideal time for marketing 
                        professionals to learn more about it and investigate how it could 
                        improve their reach and overall effectiveness with campaigns.

                    <p class="services-s3__text">
                        Although marketing with videos is gaining popularity, that doesn’t 
                        make it a guaranteed win for marketers. The results of an Irish study 
                        indicated 60% of respondents felt there was too much advertising 
                        associated with on-demand video platforms. Also, 35% said they got 
                        frustrated with those ads because they prevented them from watching 
                        their desired content.
